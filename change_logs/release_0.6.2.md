## Change Logs

### Performance

In our attempt to remediate screens lock outs, it looks like K9s performance on certain clusters took a turn for the worst. In this drop we've taken
a peek at improving some perfs tho much more in investigating remains. Big ATTA Boys! in effect to both @eldada and @despairblue for helping me track down some of these issues. We're not done by any strectch but hopefully this drop will be a bit of an improvement in the 0.6.x lineage. Thank you all for your patience and support!!
