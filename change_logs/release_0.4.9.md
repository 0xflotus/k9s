## Notes

Thank you to all that contributed with flushing out issues with K9s! I'll try to mark some of these issues as fixed. But if you don't mind grab the latest rev and see if we're happier with some of the fixes!

If you've filed an issue please help me verify and close.

## Change Logs

### Popeye

Turns out [Popeye](https://github.com/derailed/popeye) is in too much flux at present, thus I've decided to remove it from K9s for the time being.

### ContainerView

Added a container view to list all the containers available on a given pod. On a selected pod, you can now press `<enter>` to view all of it's associated containers. Once in container view pressing `<enter>` on a selected container, will show the container logs.
