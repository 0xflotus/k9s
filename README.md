# K9s - A command line application to manage your kubernetes clusters.

A CLI written in GO and curses to interact with your Kubernetes clusters.
The aim of this project is to make it easier to navigate, observe and manage
your clusters.

K9s is a CLI for Kubernetes. It provides a bit more information about your cluster
than *kubectl* while allowing to perform primordial Kubernetes commands with ease.

## Features

## Known Issues...

This initial drop is brittle. k9s will most likely blow up if...

+ Your kube-config file does not live under $HOME/.kube or you use multiple configs
+ You don't have enough RBAC fu to manage your cluster
+ Your cluster does not run a metrics-server
