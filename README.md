## Description

K8scmd is a CLI for Kubernetes. It provides a bit more information about your cluster
than *kubectl* while allowing to perform primordial Kubernetes commands with
ease.

At the time of this writing, K8scmd only supports a subset of all available Kubernetes
resources. More will be added soon (please PR us to add your favorite resource!)

## Features

> Note: K8scmd does not have an idiot light. Please be sure to hit the correct command
> sequences to avoid pilot errors. `Are you sure?` not in effect here...

+ K8scmd uses 2 or 3 letters alias to navigate to a K8s resource
+ At any time you can use `?<Enter>` to look up the various commands
+ Use `alias<Enter>` to activate a resource under that alias
+ Use `Esc` to erase previous keystrokes.
+ Use `Q` or `Ctrl-C` to Quit.
+ `Ctrl` sequences are used to view, edit, delete, ssh ...
+ Use `ctx<Enter>` to see and switch between your clusters

## Known Issues...

This initial drop is brittle. K8scmd will most likely blow up if...

+ Your kube-config file does not live under $HOME/.kube or you use multiple configs
+ You don't have enough RBAC fu to manage your cluster
+ Your cluster does not run a metrics-server
+ You have more than 9 namespaces
+ Most likely will bork on older Kubernetes revs. Guessing > 1.9+ is Ok??
+ Not sure at this time about the ill effects for large clusters??
+ Many others for sure...

## ATTA Girls/Boys!

K8scmd sits on top of two very cool GO projects that provides the much needed terminal
support. So big thanks and shootout to the good folks at tcell+tview for
making K9s a reality!!
